    Check out Yevgeniy Brikman's podcast interview with Software Engineering Radio on Infrastructure as Code best
    practices. The discussion covers similarities and differences between conventional software engineering and
    code-driven infrastructure; factoring code into modules; layering; terraform code organization for micro-services;
    releases and tagging; code reviews; unit testing infrastructure; deployment of infrastructure; ownership and code
    structure models; and open source and re-usable libraries.

    The 10:1 rule of writing and programming
  date: "August 12, 2018"
  image: "editing.jpg"
  description: |
    Writing prose and writing code have a lot in common, but perhaps the biggest similarity is that neither writers nor
    programmers can get things done on time. Writers are notorious for missing deadlines. Programmers are notorious for
    being wildly off with estimates. The question is, why?

  description: |
    Why do so many software companies and developers give away so much of their work in the form of open source,
    writing, and speaking? Why would they invest thousands of hours and millions of dollars into a project and then
    release it for free to everyone, even their competitors? In this blog post on Y Combinator's The Macro, I dive into
    the key reasons why the best companies and developers share almost everything they do, discuss some of the common
    objections to sharing, and by the end, I hope to convince you and your company to start sharing too.
